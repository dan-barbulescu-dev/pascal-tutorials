# Sieve of Eratosthenes â€“ finding out all prime numbers up to N (Pascal)

This Pascal program finds out all the prime numbers up to a number N, by using a very efficient algorithm called [The Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). How it works in short is that it goes through each number up to N, and if that number is prime, it marks all of its multiples as not prime. Thus, only the prime numbers are left unmarked and easy to recognize.
